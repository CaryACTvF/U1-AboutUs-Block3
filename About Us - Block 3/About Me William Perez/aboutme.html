    <h3 style="color: lightgreen; background: grey">All About Me</h3>

    <p>I live in Queens, New York and attend a school in Long Island City. üèô I had 3 jobs in my life span, where I worked as a babysitter for two and a intern for JFK airport for the other. I love to cook so I would like to have a interest in that career field and also like to become a phyisican maybe however that seems like a lot of jobs and I don't know if I am all about that üòÖ.</p>

    <p>I live with my mother, and my older twin brothers, they're grown still living with us which is sad but anyways, when I was young I use to live in Puerto Rico and had a dog, I was 3 so I don't recall what type of dog it was but I know I loved her. I did an entire protect on her for english junior year. üòñ Throughout my younglin times, I had to move a lot; I lived in New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Florida and New York. </p>

    <h3 style="color: lightblue; background: grey">What I glue my face to</h3>

    <p>I don't really use a lot of different technology on a daily basis, I use my Iphone with my airpods the most üì≤. I use the iPad mini that I have at home sometimes when I have a paper to write, however I am saving up to get a Macbook to help with college things and make things easier. I use safari the most and some game apps I like are Helix Jump, Crowd City and Turnscape.</p>

    <h3 style="color: darkred; background: grey">My goal in life</h3>

    <p>My goal in life at the moment is to figure out what I want and enjoy regarding college and a career, so I can have an idea of what my future will look like, I want something that motivates me to become better in things I never expected to go into or do ‚è≥.</p>
