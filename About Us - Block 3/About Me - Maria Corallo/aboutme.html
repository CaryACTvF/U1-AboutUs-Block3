	<h1 style="color:pink; background: blue; width: 205px;">ABOUT ME❗️</h1>

	<h2 style="color:pink; background: blue; width: 180px;">Maria Corallo🌈</h2>

	<h3 style="color:red; background: black; width: 110px">Biography👁</h3>

	<p style="color:red; background: black;">I am a senior at the Academy for Careers in Television and Film. My favorite subject in school is English. Last year, my cohort was production design. I also took AP English and AP U.S. History during junior year. This year, I'm only taking AP English and Composition. Outside of school, I work at a flower shop named Garden World. I work 3-4 days of the week during the schoolyear. I spend the majority of my time at school or working. For college, I'm unsure of if I wanna major in something relating to film or not. </p>

	<p style="color:red; background: black">When I'm not in school or working, I'm usually out with friends or family. I have a younger brother and an older sister. I have two cats; one older one that I've had for 11 years and one smaller one that I've had for nearly a year. I live in Queens, New York and I've lived in Queens all of my life. I like traveling; regardless of if that's on a train or an airplane.</p>

	<h3 style="color:green; background: orange; width: 120px">Technology📲</h3>

	<p style="color:green; background: orange">On a daily basis, I use multiple different forms of technology. I use my phone, I use a laptop, and I normally use a TV. I have an Amazon Alexa, but I barely use it. When using my phone, I almost always have my AirPods connected to it. My favorite search engine to use would be <a href="https://www.google.com"</a> Google</a> because it's fast and easy. My favorite games are Wordscapes, 1010, and Minecraft.</p>

	<h3 style="color:yellow; background: indigo; width: 70px">Work📝</h3>

	<p style="color:yellow; background: indigo">I've been working at Garden World for 3 years. When I'm not working as a cashier, I make bouquets or work in the greenhouse. On weekdays, I work 4-8PM shifts. On weekends, I work 9-5PM shifts. I'm one of the youngest people working there. Most of the other employees are 20 years old or older. I enjoy working there because it's educational and time consuming.</p>
