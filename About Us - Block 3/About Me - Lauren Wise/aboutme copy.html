	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>All about Lauren</h2>

	<h3>Biography</h3>

	<p>I am currently in high school at Academy for Careers in Television and Film. I have only had one job given to me through connections at a bakery for the summer of 2016 and that was the last job I had. I want to have a career in either forensic studies or working with younger kids, maybe as a socil worker or daycare worker. I want to go to University of Albany but if that doesn't work out any community college is fine.</p>

	<p>I spend a lot of time with my cat and my boyfriend mostly. I live with my mom, sister and my kitty, Bella. When I'm not home I am usually out with friends or buying clothes, sometimes both. I really like to cook but not so much cleaningðŸ’ª up afterwards. I do have a dad but he lives in Florida, which is where I grew up. I moved to New York in 2012 but moved back with my dad for another year but he went to prison so I had to come back. My dad has a youtube channel that I was on a couple of times which I thought was cool.</p>

	<h3>Technology</h3>

	<p>I have pretty basic technology. I use apple products like I have the IPhone 6S and a Macbook Air, both of which are run down and need upgrades sadly. I use my phone occasionally but I watch Hulu on my computer anytime I'm at home. I browse on google but my computer resets itself to bing and I hate it but I can't change it no matter what. I spend most of my screentime using Instagram and Snapchat but I enjoy games like Minecraft even though i kinda suck at it. I use mostly Google Chrome but when it isn't working I use Safari, which also works.</p>

	<h3>My Kitty:)</h3>

	<p>I have a kitty named Bella(mentioned in the second paragraph) who I really love and would literally give my life for. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I feel like I have a certain connection with her where we can understand eachother. I know what her meows mean and I can tell what she wants just by the way she looks at me. The only other person who feels the same way is my boyfriend and we talk to her all the time. She is kinda mean though, she bites and scratches me a lot and I don't really like it.</p>
