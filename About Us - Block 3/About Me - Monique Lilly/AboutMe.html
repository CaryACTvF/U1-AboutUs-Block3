	<h1> About Me Shorty</h1> 
	<h2>It's me Monique</h2>

	<h3>Biography - Hey Girlies!!❤️</h3>

	<p>  I go to ACTVF or Academy for Careers in Televison and Film. Last year at this school I took two AP courses, AP Language and composition as well as AP U.S. History. This year I'm taking AP Literature and AP Computer Science. I'm considering many different options for college but I'm mostly unsure, SUNY Albany seems like an amazing campus however I'm also considering staying closer to home. This summer I worked at a daycare and realized I love working with childern but I'm still unclear about my career path.</p>

	<p> When I'm not at school or doing school work I usually hangout with friends or go home and relax. At home I chill with my mom and help her take care of my nephew. I also sit with my cat because she's my babygirl.</p>

	<h3> Technology I use 📱</h3>

	<p> Everyday for many hours a day I'm on my Iphone which is an Iphone XR. I also always use my airpods to listen to music or podcasts and videos. I also use my Windows HP computer because I'm too broke boys to have a mac ;(. When I use my phone or computer my favorite search engine is <a href="https://www.google.com" </a> Google </a>because what do I look like using Bing  </p>

	<h3> What I want my future to look like</h3>

	<p>I want to have a nice house with a pretty backyard. I want to have like 2 dogs and a cat and they'll be best friends. I want to have this by he time I'm 30. I would also like to have a really good paying job and be happy to work there. May I'll have kids maybe not, if I do then 2 if not then none.</p>
