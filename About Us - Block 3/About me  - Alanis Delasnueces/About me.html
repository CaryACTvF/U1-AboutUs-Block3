	<h2>Alanis Delasnueces</h2>

	<h3>Biography üòõ</h3>
	<p>My name is Alanis Delasnueces. I live sunnyside Queens. I go to school in Academy for Carrers in Telivison and Flim and I am a senior. My possible college major is phsychology. I would like to work with adults or criminals in bettering their mind. I dont know what college i would like to go to and i dont even know if i wanna go away and dorm. Im pretty much not organized at all when i come to my future.</p>

	<p>My family is a family of four. I have a sister and both of my parents are in my life. I have no pets but i would really like a dog and trying to persuade my parents to get one at the moment. I dont really have any hobbies as i really dont do much at home besides like watching tv or listening to music.</p>

	<h3>Technology üì≤</h3>
	<p>The technology i use in my house is mainly my phone. sometimes when i need to type something fo school or work online ill use my laptop. I also watch alot of tv like netflix and other tv programs. I listen to alot of music so i mostly use my airpods with my phone. I guess if i had to choose my favorite seach engine it would be <a href="https://google.com" </a> google </a> since thats the most popular but it doesnt really matter to me. My favorite apps are probably social media apps since thats really what i use my phone for.</p>

	<h3>My future üëµ</h3>
	<p>When i think about my future i can see myself going to college and studying physcology in a small college. By 26 i want to have a steady job in order to be ready to buy a house somehwhere in Long island or any where a little outside of the city. I want to be married by 28 and start a family before im 30. My future scares me but at the same time im exicted. </p>
