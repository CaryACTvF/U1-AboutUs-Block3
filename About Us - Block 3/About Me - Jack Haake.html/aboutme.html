		<h2 style="background-color: red;"">Jack Haake <h2>

		<h4 style ="background-color: white">Biography😏<h4>

		<p style ="background-color: white""> I am a student of the school Academy for Careers in Television and Film. I used to be interested in film when I was younger but not so much anymore, I've been leaning more toward choosing a college major in English. I'm not a big reader, but when I do get into a book, I try to understand it to the best of my ability and am interested in writing essays about the book itself as well.
		<p style ="background-color: white""> A very big hobby of mine is playing video games. When I was a kid, my Dad bought me a Sega Dreamcast and ever since then I have been a big video game player. I live with my Mom and my younger sister, we have 3 dogs named Gizmo, Saki, and Kylie. I also have an older sister who is attending college at Courtland.

		<h4 style ="background-color: white">Technology😴<h4>



		<p style ="background-color: white"> The technology I use on a daily basis is my phone, my laptop, my alexa, and my desktop. I use my phone throughout the day and connect to my Alexa to play music while I play video games on my desktop. My laptop I use when I just want to relax on my bed.

		<h4 style ="background-color: white">Goals👎<h4>
		<p style ="background-color: white"> I have just entered my senior year and, obviously, college is very heavy on my mind. So far, I have struggled with what I want to major in and my goal is to finally find a hobby I am satisfied with and a hobby that I could turn into a successful career.</p>
