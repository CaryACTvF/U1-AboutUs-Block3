	<p style="line-height: 20px">My name is Jayson Arreaga and i live in Brooklyn, Ny. Im a senior at a highschool called the Academy for Careers in Television and Film. I've taken part in a numerous amounts of volunteer programs at a nursing home in Brooklyn building my social experience. I would love to enter the police force and try and reach NYPD Swat as my future career of choice. The courses i would love to take part in are criminal justice and political science.</p>

Some of my hobbies include reading, playing pickup football games and of course like every other teenage boy, i love to play video games.</p>
	<h3 style="color: blue"><u><i>Everyday Tech</i></u></h3>
	<p>My entire life as most people nowadays functions around technology, from my smartphone to my computer. I use a wide variety of tech from different companies with different purposes. For example, I use my amazon Alexa over Apples Siri due to the quicker response time and it has more featues. But when it comes to Smartphones i believe that the iPhone is top tier in terms of full usage. In terms of search engines i've always found that google chrome is alwasy the best in terms of search results and again the different features that it grants. When it comes to videogames i've always been a big fan of sandbox games as they allow for me to run around and allow my imagination to truly run wild.</p>
