<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Sierra Warren</h2>

<h3>Biography</h3>

<p>As I enter my senior year the reality of becoming an adult begins to sink in. Moving forward this year I hope to find a college that can help me acheve my dreams. Here in highschool I discovered I love interior design. My dream is to build my own company where I can create and disign homes for people. Going into college I'm not sure what majors or classes and help me with this but I'm excited to find out.</p>

<p>Family is very important to me. Growing up my older sister was diagnosed with cancer, and when she passed it made me realise the importance of family and how I shouldn't take any moment for granted. Living along side my younger sister, my mom, my dad, and my two cats, in the home that my parents created for me I feel very hesitent going off to college when I know it might be best for me.  </p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>Every day I tend to use my phone, my macbook, an alexa, and TV. On my personal computer I always use firefox and google. Instagram has my life :) </p> 

<h3>Cats :)</h3>

<p> My two cats are the most beautiful things in the entire world. Tera is a little chubby but is so sweet and lovable. Mimi is 100% a mom you do not want to mess with.
