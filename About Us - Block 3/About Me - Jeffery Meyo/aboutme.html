<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>I go to Academy for Television and Films, I'm a senior and this school has been really good. I was in sound last year and it was a really good experince working along with other cohorts, getting the sense of an actual shoot. This summer I was actually working in construstion with one of my cousins and all I can say is that it was really exhausting. Working for long hours in the hot weather was not really my thing. In the future I would like to involve myself in real estate and sell houses, apartments, or cars. I'm still kinda undecided on what colleges I want to go to.

	<p>In my free time I like to hang out with friends and my family. I have four siblings, two brothers and two sisters who are way older then me. I'm the baby in the family and they are all on top of me, which is a good thing always guiding me in the right way. I have a couple of pets at home, one dog and two cats. I love my dog, he has watched me grow from a litte kid to almost an adult. For my hobbies I go to boxing. Boxing is one of my passions its something I always look foward to throughout my day. 


<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p1>For technology I mainly use only my phone. I have a Iphone 7 and mainly use it for social media. I also have a macbook whcih is like from 6 years ago and its kinda slow but still helps me with all my school work.
