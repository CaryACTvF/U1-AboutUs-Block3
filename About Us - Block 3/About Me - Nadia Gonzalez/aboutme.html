	<h1 style="color: maroon; background: darkgray; margin: 0px;">About Me</h1>

	<h2 style="color: white; background: black; margin: 0px;">Nadia Gonzalez</h2>

	<h3 style="color: maroon; background: darkgray; margin: 0px;">Biography</h3>

	<p style="color: white; background: black; margin: 0px;">I am a senior at the Academy for Careers in Television and Film in Long Island City. When I graduate I want to pursue a career in filmmaking, specifically in cinematography. I have done two internships thus far that are in the field of filmmaking and want to continue doing so. I am looking to major in Film Produciton in college as well.</p>

	<p style="color: white; background: black; margin: 0px;">I don't have many hobbies, I sleep when I can. However, when I'm not at school or sleeping (or both) I am watching Netflix or I'm with family. I have a dog named Blake, he is an idiot but I love him. I have 2 brothers, a twin brother named Aidan (a lot of people find it cool that my name is his name spelled backwards and vice versa), he is two minutes older than me, and Rafael who is 1 year older than me.</p>

	<h3 style="color: maroon; background: darkgray; margin: 0px;">Technology</h3>

	<p style="color: white; background: black; margin: 0px;">Everyday I use my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S8, most of all for Spotify, Instagram, and Twitter. The web browser I use is Google Chrome and the search engine I use is Google. I listen to a rockband called The Warning all the time, they're amazing, stream their music on all platforms.</p>

	<h3 style="color: maroon; background: darkgray; margin: 0px;">TV Shows</h3>

	<p style="color: white; background: black; margin: 0px;">Anyone who knows me for a short period of time knows about my obsession with Tv Shows, one being a Canadian sci-fi show called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRg69ZH6NYQ&list=PLX5Az9LAnbkR5fHrKacYmDl3H1Pd2wQwW&index=28">Wynonna Earp</a>. Everyone is definitely tired of me mentioning it (I truly don't talk about it in person much, I'm embarrassed when people try to talk to me about it in fact) but it means a lot to me regardless. More shows I am into are Jessica Jones, Workin Moms, Lost Girl, Orange is the New Black, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Russian Doll. Something that all those shows have in common are strong female lead characters, which is something I look for in a show. As a viewer, representation of myself on screen matters a lot.</p>
