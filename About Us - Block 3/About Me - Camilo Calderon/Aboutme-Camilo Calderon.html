	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>All about me</h2>

	<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>I am currently going to the academy for careers in television and film and surprise surprise, I like film. Specifically I like the camera department where I handle alot of technical gear so you can somewhat say I am Techy. I think of it as more creative in its precision of framing and focus. FilmðŸŽ¬ is becoming more of a fleeting interest to me, I also see interest in becoming a teacher or perhaps president as I get into politics(I am a radical progressive by the wayðŸ™‚). </p>

	<P>Me personally I grew up in a family of four with a catðŸ˜º. My parents are activist in education and in film so it makes sense that those would be my possible career options. My Brother is four years older than me so naturally I have to live up to his successes,I know my family probably doesnt feel that way but I do only because I believe it further motivates me. As far as personal hobbies I used to make youtube videos but that was just a way of stretching out my creative side but there all terrible pieces of content that no one should see(My contempt for some things can be very strongðŸ™„).Overall I'd say im a happy person with a normal life and I cannot wait for the crazy things I do in the future</P>

	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>My interest in technology is very common consumer type knowledge and as I learn more in this class,I often brag about my "hacking skills"ðŸ˜ˆ. In terms of what I use, as I have said I own a dinosaur age computer(2011 Macbook pro) also including a PS4 video game console, Ipad air ,Iphone 7(the best cheapest iphone so far). Favorite app as of now is youtube due to all the content it provides, without youtube life would be drastically different. I'm not really the article reading kind of guy so I would not be involved in the world without youtube.Google is the main web browser and that goes for 88% of all searches on the internet, some argue that google should be broken up as if its a major oil company in the 1920s. Things are different, no one is gonna use the 4th best search engine out there. There is better ways to deal with innovation.</p>

	<h3>Andrew Yang is going to be the next president</h3>

	<p>As I have said I am heavily into politics and from looking at the race I have concluded that the Yanggang is going to be succesful.In a big race like this it is very important to rule out candidates so it is better to make a decision. For me if your a centrist and have fundraising parties that serve coporate interest then you are not my president. That leaves about 5-6 candidates left but I want someone who will fundamentally change my life and 1000 dollars a month is simply that. Im not in the business of writing a essay as of now so go to Yang2020 and find out for yourself,he's gonna be here for a long time so you should get to know him.</p>
