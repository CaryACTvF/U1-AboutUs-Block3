	<h2>Come on down!</h2>

	<h3>Biographyüëº</h3>

	<p>My name is jeff stewart, I am a senior in highschool. I like gripping and lighting in film production. I worked as a garderner for a summer and thats my only job so far. I am extremely intrested in computer programing and all things computer but im not sure what I want to do for college. I enjoy archeryüèπ, fishingüé£ and most other outdoor activities. </p>

	<p>I have no brothers or sisters, i'm an only child and i'm glad. I have three pets two cats and a dog. I'm more of a dog person but I love my cats.</p>

	<h3>Technologyüìª</h3>

	<p>I have grown up around technology just like most of those in this class. My dad is a computer programer and I've always had an intrest in it. I use my 3ds, my amazon pad, my over ear headphones, my google home, my self built comuter, my tv or my phone and I'm very thankful for every single item I have. In terms of tech experince I am very knowledgeable on the hardware side but im lacking alot on the programing. My favorite search engine is chrome clearly because it is the best.üóø</p>

	<h3>Living in nyc</h3>

	<p>I love living in nyc, its the best thing about my life. The subways, the resturaunts, the people, the nightlife, everything is perfect. I'm so glad that i was lucky enough to have parents that bought a house when it was cheap because it would be too expensive to live now. I'm more than happy with where i live.</p>
